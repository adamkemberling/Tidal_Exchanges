# Why Quarto?

If you already use markdown or RMarkdown, you may ask yourself "why switch to quarto?" As new quarto users, our switch has been mostly driven by improved access to a wide variety of formatting options and tools to make the code and documents we already write better.

#### This tutorial

We set up this "highly sophisticated" document to reflect the default features and formatting already available in RMarkdown. Use this as your starting point to try out the following:

-   Transition an RMarkdown file into quarto

-   Set different formatting for PDF vs. HTML outputs

-   Add custom CSS formatting for HTML outputs

-   Explore options to include plots and figures, including alt-text

-   Change document formatting to include interactivity, columns, and figure labels

-   Change document font formatting

-   Add citations & equations

# All the example content:

Quarto processes .qmd files similarly to .rmd files but takes a final step to process in pandoc that allows for some additional features to be included (e.g. super easy inclusion of citations).

![](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-qmd-how-it-works.png)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Figure 1: An example plot. I am sure you can add figure captions in an RMarkdown document but we are sticking to lazy examples here with minimal formatting.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species=="Adelie") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm))
```

Figure 2: Another example plot.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species=="Chinstrap") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm))
```

Figure 3: Another example plot identical to Figure 2 but looking at a different penguin species.

## Here is a lazy equation

`y=mx+b (Eq. 1)`

Wouldn't it be nice to index `m` and `b` variables by species of penguin?

## And more text!

Here is an example paragraph. Isn't it great. Sometimes we cite literature in our text like this (Kerr et al. 2010; Pershing et al. 2015). But then, we need to include a references section. We may also mention the results shown in figures (Figure 1, 2, 3) and discuss the calculations in Equation 1.
